## What is GymInOne?
GymInOne is an iOS app that generates personalised workout routines tailored for gym beginners. Users can specify their weekly gym attendance frequency and select their goal, whether it's hypertrophy or strength training. After inputting these details, the app presents a floating grid interface that allows users to seamlessly navigate through their customised workout plan, organized by day. Each day's routine includes a diverse range of exercises, along with the prescribed number of sets and reps. This interactive interface allows the users to easily follow their custom workout routine during their gym sessions.
